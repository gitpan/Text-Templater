1.3
The primary change is the added support for nested data structures.
Better support for errors and warnings.

- Nested data structure in the fashion name="employees.programmers"
- If id is specified, the value is not printed but only recorded for late use.
- The method getError and getWarnings was added. 
  If the module fails it will return undef and set the appropriate variables 
  with error or warning messages. no die in here !
- A test script was added.
- Package with Module::Build

1.2
Changes done was primarly simple bug fix and added support for integration 
inside xml documents. 

- Removed getSourceFILE method
  Sorry but the method had nothing to do there.
- Bug fix with negative value of index property
  If you specify negative value greater than the values array set, all the array is displayed.
- The id property was added
- Bug fix with list in combination with index and nullout
  The bug was that the list constant fallowed the index. 
  So list="CONSTANT:1,2" index="1" made CONSTANT == 2.
