Changes done was primarly simple bug fix and added support for integration 
inside xml documents. 

- Removed getSourceFILE method
  Sorry but the method had nothing to do there.

- Bug fix with negative value of index property
  If you specify negative value greater than the values array set, all the array is displayed.

- The id property was added

- Bug fix with list in combination with index and nullout
  The bug was that the list constant fallowed the index. 
  So list="CONSTANT:1,2" index="1" made CONSTANT == 2.
