1.4
Fine tunning of error detections and ability to properly index nested structure.

- The index property have been removed. The problem was when adding the nested
  structure feature it became needed to index under structures. So now you can
  write name="test[2].me[0]".
  
- setData does not accept ST or CGI object anymore.
  I beleive that it's not the responsability of the Templater object to know
  how to fetch information from other objects. You could instead implement a
  registry that would do it for you. A quick and dirty one is at 
  "t/lib/DataRegistry.pm".
  
- More precise error and warnings message
  Line and column is "trying" to be given. :-)

1.3
The primary change is the added support for nested data structures.
Better support for errors and warnings.

- Nested data structure in the fashion name="employees.programmers"

- If id is specified, the value is not printed but only recorded for late use.

- The method getError and getWarnings was added. 
  If the module fails it will return undef and set the appropriate variables 
  with error or warning messages. no die in here !
  
- A test script was added.

- Package with Module::Build

1.2
Changes done was primarly simple bug fix and added support for integration 
inside xml documents. 

- Removed getSourceFILE method
  Sorry but the method had nothing to do there.
  
- Bug fix with negative value of index property
  If you specify negative value greater than the values array set, all the 
  array is displayed.
  
- The id property was added

- Bug fix with list in combination with index and nullout 
  The bug was that the list constant fallowed the index. 
  So list="CONSTANT:1,2" index="1" made CONSTANT == 2.
